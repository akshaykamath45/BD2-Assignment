# Introduction

TripWithUs is a new platform started by a group in Bangalore to list hotels from all over the world. They aim to make hotel discovery easy by allowing users to filter and sort hotels based on their preferences. Currently, they are focusing on a few categories, amenities, and countries and plan to expand over time.

This project involves developing backend APIs to support the platformâ€™s frontend. The APIs handle hotel filtering, sorting, and logging user actions.

# Objective

TripWithUs has tasked you with creating backend APIs to power their hotel listing platform. The APIs must support filtering and sorting hotels by various criteria such as price, ratings, reviews, categories, amenities, and countries.

# Express Server Integration with Frontend

This repository contains backend APIs developed using Express.js and deployed on Vercel. These APIs are integrated with a frontend hosted [here](https://bd2-hotel-listing.vercel.app/).

## Features

- Sorting options: Pricing, Ratings, and Reviews.
- Filtering options:
  - **Categories**: Mid-Range, Family, Luxury, Boutique, Resort, Budget.
